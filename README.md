Written in Typescript using drag and drop interface as a learning exercise.

## Running locally
While in the root of the project import dependencies:
```npm install```

to run local lite-server dev environment. which will run locally on port 3000 by default.
```npm start```

If you are doing further development work, it's then suggested you run typescript compiler in watch mode in a seperate terminal instance:
```tsc -w```
